// Gamma correction code and values developed by Jason Clark https://github.com/elmerfud
// Gamma correction compensates for our eyes' nonlinear perception of
// intensity.  It's the LAST step before a pixel value is stored, and
// allows intermediate rendering/processing to occur in linear space.
// The table contains 256 elements (8 bit input), though the outputs are
// only 7 bits (0 to 127).  This is normal and intentional by design: it
// allows all the rendering code to operate in the more familiar unsigned
// 8-bit colorspace (used in a lot of existing graphics code), and better
// preserves accuracy where repeated color blending operations occur.
// Only the final end product is converted to 7 bits, the native format
// for the LPD8806 LED driver.  Gamma correction and 7-bit decimation
// thus occur in a single operation.
